Heyo, you can use this code however you want, just don't claim this as your own and make sure to credit this repo.
Feel free to uuh learn from this.
If you have any questions, just DM me on Discord, my name on there is **BJEELAA#6666**

# explanation

quick explanation... make a file named "botconfig.json" and make it look like this:
```json
{
    "token":"your discord bot token",
    "prefix":"prefix for your discord bot"
}
```

all the rest is pretty straight-forward, go to [index.js](./index.js) and just look at what's just in front of the brackets and it should tell you what it does

example: ".setActivity()" sets the activity, told ya it was obvious ;)

if you try to blatantly steal my code, i'll be mad so uuh don't :/

feel free to dm me on discord for any questions tho (BJEELAA#6666)
